# Code refactor Horiseon webpage

## Description

Refactoring the the codebase for Horiseon aimed to optimise the client's website for search engines and follow accessibility standards.

During the process I've learned how to apply the alt attribute to images and icons in HTML file, providing a detailed description that can be used by screen readers as part of accessibility.
